# adaptiveperm

`adaptiveperm` is an R package that implements methods introduced by the paper "Multiple testing with anytime-valid Monte-Carlo p-values" by L Fischer et al. Currently, the package provides only two functions: `run_permutation_test()` and `evaluate_simulation_results()`. See the documentation for these functions via `?run_permutation_test` and `?evaluate_simulation_results`. Download this package via `devtools::install_github("timothy-barry/adaptiveperm")` and load the package via `library(adaptiveperm)`.
